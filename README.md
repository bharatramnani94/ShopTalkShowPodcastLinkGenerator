# ShopTalkShowPodcastLinkGenerator
This simple python script generates an HTML page containing all the audio links of all (customisable) the episodes of the podcast present at ShopTalkShow.com.
The generated page can be then used by IDM grabber or other such utility to download all the audio (episodes) at once.
